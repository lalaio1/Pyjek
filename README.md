# 🛠️ Pyjek

![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)

**Pyjek** is a Python project designed to execute a malicious `.py` or `.pyw` file alongside a legitimate project. This script compiles and obfuscates the malicious code, seamlessly integrating it with a genuine project, and ensures the execution of both, effectively masking the malicious intent under the guise of legitimate operations.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Pyjek
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
