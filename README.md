# 🛠️ Pyjek

![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)

A Python project designed to execute a malicious .py/.pyw file alongside a legitimate project. This script compiles and obfuscates the malicious code, integrates it seamlessly with a genuine project, and ensures the execution of both, effectively masking the malicious intent under the guise of legitimate operations.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

## 📥 Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lalaio1/Pyjek
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Pyjek
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, execute:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
