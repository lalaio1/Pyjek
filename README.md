# Pyjek
A Python project designed to execute a malicious .py/.pyw file alongside a legitimate project. This script compiles and obfuscates the malicious code, integrates it seamlessly with a genuine project, and ensures the execution of both, effectively masking the malicious intent under the guise of legitimate operations.
